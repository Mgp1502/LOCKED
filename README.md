# LOCKED
program for tracking info in locked_out (wow addon) data file and update a database with the selected informations.

Install guide:
- Make sure you have the "LOCKED_OUT" addon installed for your WoW instance (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/lockedout)
- Download the "LOCKED1.0.zip" file below and extract it.
- Start LOCKED.exe (starts in the system tray, click the lock icon to open window).

In the program:
- Find your WoW installation path. (C:\World of Warcraft)
- Find characters and select the ones you want to track.
- Click save selected.

If you always want the most updated keys uploaded I would recommend adding a shortcut to the LOCKED.exe in your startup folder. (C:\Users\\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
