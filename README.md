# LOCKED
Program for uploading information from World of Warcraft to a database so a discord bot can help manage stuff like current mythic keystone on characters.

Install guide:
- You need to have the AB_LOCKED addon (https://github.com/Zaltany/AB_Locked)
- Download the newest release (https://github.com/Mgp1502/LOCKED/releases) and unzip program somewhere.
- Start the LOCKED.exe (should open a window, if not look in the system tray for a small lock icon)

In the program:
- Find your WoW installation path and insert in the top part. (example -> C:\World of Warcraft)
- Press search for your characters and select the ones you want to keep track off.
- Click save selected.

Then as long as the program is running in the background/system tray it send the data stored by the addon every 5 minutes or so. (the addon only saves data when you log out of the game)

So if you always want the most updated keys uploaded I would recommend adding a shortcut to the LOCKED.exe in your startup folder. (usally found here -> C:\Users\\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
